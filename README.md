# Experimental-design-
The assignment requires you to create an R script that imports a transcriptomics dataset
and exports an annotated data file that is suitable for downstream biological analysis, such
as pathway and network analysis.


The dataset that you will use for this is already familiar. We will be using an RNA-
sequencing dataset from the MAGNet consortium1. To generate this dataset2, left
ventricular free-wall tissue was harvested at the time of cardiac surgery from subjects with
heart failure undergoing transplantation and from unused donor hearts with apparently
normal function. This dataset is a spectacular resource of left ventricular transcriptomes of
non-failing healthy donors, Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Next to the RNA-
sequencing data (in log2-transformed CPM values), extensive participant information is
available (age, sex, ethnicity, disease state, and so on).
